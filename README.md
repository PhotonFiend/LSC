# LSC
Monte Carlo simulation of a LSC

This project aims to create a Monte Carlo simulation platform for LSCs. The current version has been optimised and tested against a real-world flourescent dye (based on the absorption and emission spectra). Future versions aim to include the following features:
  -GUI
	-Option to define other regular geometries
	-Option to import irregular geometry from 3D data
